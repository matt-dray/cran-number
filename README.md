# What?

A simple app to demonstrate the [Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon). But it's for CRAN packages. And [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) is Kevin Bacon.

The app demonstrates [the tiny {kevinbacran} package](https://matt-dray.github.io/kevinbacran/) for examining the shortest paths between any two authors from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/).

The app fixes one of those authors as [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/) given that he is named as author on a large number of packages on CRAN, particularly in [the tidyverse suite](https://www.tidyverse.org/)).

# Access

The app is live here: https://mattdray.shinyapps.io/hadley-number/ (hosted for free with [shinyapps.io](http://www.shinyapps.io/) and is throttled at 25 hours of use per month; I may also take it down at any time.)

# Kudos

The app is built with [{shiny}](http://www.shinyapps.io/) and includes [{shinyhelper}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=shinyhelper ) from [Chris Mason-Thom](https://github.com/cwthom).
